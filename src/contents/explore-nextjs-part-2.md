Welcome back! In part 1, we covered Next.js basics. Now, let's dive into more advanced topics using the **Pages Router** in Next.js.

## 🤩 Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing allows you to create pages with dynamic segments in the URL. For example, if you want to create a blog post page where the post ID is dynamic, you can create a file named `[id].js` inside the `/pages/posts` directory.

## 🛠️ API Routes
Next.js allows you to create API endpoints using the `/pages/api` directory. Each file in this directory is treated as an API route.
